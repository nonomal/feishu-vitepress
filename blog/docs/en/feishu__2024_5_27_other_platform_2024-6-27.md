Xia Chengxi is a Taiwanese graduate of Fudan University Law School. At the graduation ceremony of Fudan University Law School on June 19, 2023. He came to the stage and slapped the professor at the school, which made major news headlines. He did it because he wanted to drop out. And he has been admitted to the Peking University Medical School. No wonder Xia Chengxi can't look down on Fudan.

Is Xia Chengxi a talent? Not. It's just that because of his special status, as a compatriot from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, he doesn't have to pass the exam if he wants to go to Fudan. You only need to reach the top mark level. What is the top standard, the top standard is only used in the top 12% of the college entrance examination in Taiwan. And as long as the top standard is reached, basically 985 universities in my country (including Thanh Hoa Peking University) can go to it casually. is so envious, no wonder Xia Chengxi looks down on Fudan, because people can go to Tsinghua University and Peking University.

Think about our college entrance examination, there are few in a province that can go to Tsinghua University and Peking University. Only champions can be picked at will.

Thousands of students have been working on sea line tactics since elementary school. After studying hard for more than ten years, it can be 985.

But Xia Chengxi doesn't need these at all, for them, going to 985 is such an easy thing.

Do we get gratitude for being so kind to them? In exchange for recognition?

No, only in exchange for a slap and contempt from him.

Fudan, which exists like a god in the hearts of students, is not a fart in the eyes of Xia Chengxi. Because it's too easy for them. It doesn't take much effort to get it, so they won't cherish it. Anyway, there's something better waiting ahead.

I have long known that this society is inherently unfair, and I am just complaining about the injustice of thousands of students in China, this kind of injustice that borders on discrimination, and their efforts have become worthless. And it's a bit pathetic!
