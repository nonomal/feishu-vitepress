# Product introduction required

Product Type:

# Pain points:

The official account is not easy to write articles, and it lacks many formatting tools. I wanted to write articles in a similar way to the Feishu Docs or Notion experience

Each platform is independent, and it is very inhumane to write an article and publish it on different platforms. One-click publishing to all platforms is required

To write an article, you need to write it like Feishu, and there is no open source solution for this feature at present
