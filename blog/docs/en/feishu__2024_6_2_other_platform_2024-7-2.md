Jiang Ping, a student at Jiangsu Lianshui Secondary Professional School, has attracted attention for her 12th place in the 2024 Alibaba Global Mathematics Competition Qualifiers. _

It was a positive story at first. Everyone praised her as a genius and admired her great determination to continue to persevere in her favorite math major and finally achieve results. There are many students majoring in mathematics at Peking University and Tsinghua University in front of him on the rankings, who are bleak in front of her grades.

But then, things took a turn for the worse, and some people began to question her, believing it to be an academic deception. Their main points are as follows:

The following is an excerpt from Professor Yuan Xinyi's "Analysis of the Doubts in the Jiang Ping Incident" by Professor Yuan Xinyi of the Beijing International Mathematical Research Center of Peking University

1. It is impossible for a junior high school student to complete high school mathematics and undergraduate mathematics in two years.

2, Jiang Ping made a mistake in the symbol in the board book in the video, which is not the level of a highly talented student in mathematics. (As shown below, the errors marked in red)

3. It is impossible for a secondary school student to be proficient in using the mathematics-specific formula software "LaTex" to write formulas. Suspicious!

4. Jiang Ping only scored 83 points in a school math test (not the level of a math genius)

Judging from the above points of view, they are all just suspicions, and none of them is direct evidence of Jiang Ping's cheating.

But in the Chinese Internet environment, this kind of indirect questioning is very popular, and a group of melon-eating people were originally surprised and envious after seeing a low-level person being held up to the sky. Now I am overjoyed to see this low-level person being questioned. They don't care whether these doubts are reliable or not, and they must be thinking in their hearts: "Look, I guessed right, I knew it was fake." ‚Äù

Mathematics was originally a rigorous discipline of proof. And Professor Yuan Xinyi wrote an article of more than 6,000 words without direct evidence to prove his views, which is really remarkable. I think Professor Yuan Xinyi should also be a small-town problem-solver, and it took decades of cold windows to get to his current status. Suddenly, a 17-year-old underage female student who was not admitted to high school is more famous than herself, and her psychology is indeed a little unbalanced. So it is understandable that he used his strength to eat milk, searched for all kinds of news on the Internet, and held back all kinds of doubts and conjectures.

Seeing that the people around us suddenly have made achievements, it is indeed reasonable for us to be a little jealous, but we will not be suppressed because of this, right? What kind of psychology is this?

Of course, if you have direct evidence, that's okay. But now you don't have it at all.

Is it just because she's a student in a small place? Oh, too, there are a few famous middle school students in Shanghai in the preliminaries list announced by Ali. No one seems to doubt whether they are faking or not.

Whether Jiang Ping is a cheater or not, the official has its own conclusion. But this group of clowns who jump off the beam, questioning for no reason, and spreading remarks without evidence in order to gain traffic, is a bit shameful!
